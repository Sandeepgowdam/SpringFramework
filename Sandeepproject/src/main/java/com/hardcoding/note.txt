when ever the class is depandency of other class at time we will assign one bean to other that technique 
is called as hardCoding

when ever your are hardCoding complsory you need to create default constructor or else it will throw an error

		Object o1 = context.getBean("s3");
		Student s3 = (Student) o1; 
		
here the context.getBean is a Object class so to convert to primitive we are explictly type cast(down cast)
 
 Student s3= (Student) context.getBean("s3");	
 
 
 here the hard coding is lenthy procedure we must keeps assigning one bean to other so to avoid this 
 autowire is implemented
